# Supervised Learning

'right answers' given

- Regression
	- predict contiuous valued output (E.g. price. So, maybe prices are actually discrete value. But usually, we think of the price of a house as a real number, as a scalar value, as a continuous value number, and the term regression refers to the fact that we're trying to predict the sort of continuous values attribute.)

- Classification
	- discrete valued output


* Question. You’re running a company, and you want to develop learning algorithms to address each of two problems. 

- Problem 1: You have a large inventory of identical items. You want to predict how many of these items will sell over the next 3 months.

- Problem 2: You’d like software to examine individual customer accounts, and for each account decide if it has been hacked/compromised. 

Should you treat these as classification or as regression problems?

* Answer: Problem 1 -- regression. Problem 2 -- classification.
