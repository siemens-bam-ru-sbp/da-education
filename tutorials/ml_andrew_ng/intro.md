# Intro

Examples of applications:

- DB mining
  - medical records
  - biology
  
- Applications can't program by hand:
  - autonomous helicopter (flips, inverted hover)

- Self-customizing programs
  - profuct recomendations
 
- Understanding human learning
  - brain
  - real AI
  
  
 ## What is ML?
 
 - Arthur Samuel (1959). Checkers playing.  The field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly learned.
 
 - Tom Mitchel (1998). A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

* Question. Suppose your email program watches which emails you do or do not mark as spam, and based on that learns how to better filter spam. What is the task T in this setting?


 - Classify emails as spam or not spam. (T)
 - Watching you label emails as spam or not spam. (E)
 - The number (or fraction) of emails correctly classified as spam/not spam. (P)
 - None of the above, this is not a machine learning algorithm.


 The main two types are what we call 
 - supervised learning 
 - unsupervised learning.

Others: reinforcement learning and recommender systems.
